# PacMen Exercise

Here we had to create multiple "pacmen" bouncing around the active window. Fully in Javascript! With a timer we were able to achieve this result, and also getting the current window size, so the location and the velocity of every pacmen changes.

### How to run

- Download the files in zip format,
- Make sure you open the index.html with a browser (favoroubly Google Chrome),
- To add 1 PacMan, click the button "add PacMan",
- To let them go free, running, click "Start Game",
- To restart: refresh the browser or F5 in Windows, CMD+R on Mac!

Enjoy!

### Future improvements

This repository is actually finished, but it would be nice to implement some user movement on these pacmen, for example to use the keyboard to move some of them!
